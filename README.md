# Linear Regression Implementation from scratch for Used Car Price Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of linear regression from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. The implementation is applied to a dataset of used cars to predict their prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises information about used cars, including features such as mileage, year of manufacture, make, model, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is substantial, occupying approximately 2 GB of storage, ensuring a rich and diverse set of data for training and evaluation.

## Implementation

The linear regression algorithm implemented in this repository follows a step-by-step approach to train a model using gradient descent optimization. The process involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as necessary.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features, transforming data if needed, and preparing it for model training.

3. **Model Training**: Implementing the linear regression algorithm, initializing model parameters, and optimizing them using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.

4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, and visualizing the results.

5. **Prediction**: Utilizing the trained model to predict the prices of used cars based on new input data.

## Usage

To utilize this implementation for used car price prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need Python 3.x along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
